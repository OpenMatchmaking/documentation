# Authorization / Authentication microservice

### Why 
- Get an opportunity to restrict users, so that they can't send requests to microservices without required credentials and permissions.
- Provide for developers the solution for cases when OpenMatchmaking should work with the dedicated authorization/authentication server, withot communicating with existing authorization/authentication servers.
- Necessary to store an information about users and let them to get (or refresh) an access token.

### Benefits of using
- Can be used as the 3rd party authorization/authentication service for restricting an access in a pair with [reverse proxy](https://github.com/OpenMatchmaking/documentation/blob/master/docs/components/reverse-proxy.md#reverse-proxy)
- A good choice for cases when OpenMatchmaking should work independently, without communicating with other services (not related to OpenMatchmaking)
